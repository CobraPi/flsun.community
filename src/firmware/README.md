# Firmwares

Firmwares are an essential part of every 3D printer! A lot rides on proper on the proper firmware for the proper board!
## Official Firmwares

Inside the zip files, there are usually 6 different rar files:
- QQ with leveling pad
- QQ with leveling switch
- QQ-S with leveling pad
- QQ-S with leveling switch
- QQ-S with leveling pad, different-looking icons ("new UI")
- QQ-S with leveling switch, different-looking icons ("new UI")

Extract the proper one for your configuration.

> Note: the new UI version for QQ-S has mistakes in the "robin_mini_cfg.txt" file.

If you choose this version, you should get the robin_mini_cfg.txt file from the other (2.3) version. (If you can't extract the rar files, install a program such as 7-Zip.)
